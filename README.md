This is the code git repository for the ICSEDS (Imperial College branch of SEDS) HAB project.

This code was used for the HAB launch on 3 November 2018 from Elsworth,UK. The payload was launched after the GPS lost lock.
The final code that flew on the arduino is code_for_autumn_launch.ino
Most of the other code is test code to test the various components on the board(the gps, temperature sensors etc)
